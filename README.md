# stacks-automated_warehouse-dstr
This is the first part of my Data Structure (DSTR) assignment
This project is about using stacks to develop an automated warehouse:
a robot will unload a truck until it is full
it then go inside the warehouse and place the merchandises into storage bin
it go back to the truck
it continue until the truc is empty
